## The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript
TypeScript is a object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft, which is mainly built on top of JavaScript with extra built-in features. This language allows us to enhance code maintainability and catch errors or bugs before the program gets executed in runtime. There are several types in TypeScript which are the core features of TypeScript used from debug code. Among these features are union and intersection types, which helps us to create flexible and robust type definitions for applications.

# What are union types?
- Union allows a variable to hold values of multiple specified types. Its helpful when you want a value to be one of several types rather than a specific type. Here's an example:

- let result: string | number;
  result = "Success"; // This one is valid
  result = 42; // This is valid too

- In this example result can be either a string or a number.

# Why Union types of important?
- Useful for handling scenorios where a variable might have different types in different contexts.
- Provides more flexibility without sacrificing type safety.

# What are Intersection types?
- Intersection types are typescript feature that allows you to combine multiple types into a single, unified type that includes all properties than each type. This is useful when you want a object or variable to meet multiple requirements at once. Here's an example:

- type UserType = { name: string; email: string };
  type AdminType = { role: "admin"; permissions: string[] };
  type AdminUser = UserType & AdminType;

  const admin: AdminUser = {
  name: "Shahriar Samir",
  email: "samir@gmail.com",
  role: "admin",
  permissions: ["add","remove","update"],
};

- In this example result can be either a string or a number.

# Why Intersection types of important?
- Helps in creating complex data types that carry the attributes of multiple types.
- Provides an feature to add multiple required types by merging them with less code.


# Conclusion
- Union and Intersection types are powerful tools in TypeScript that allow us to create complex types from existing ones. Union types let us declare a type that could be one of several types, while Intersection types allow us to combine multiple types into one. These features make our code more flexible and reusable, and they are essential for writing complex TypeScript applications.
